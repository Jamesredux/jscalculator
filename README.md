#Created as the final project of the js 101 section of the odin project.


#Assignment
Here are some use cases (abilities your project needs to have):
Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browser's console.
add
subtract
multiply
divide

There should also be a display for the calculator.

Add a "clear" button.

Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer: 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 etc.

You should round answers with long decimals so that they don't overflow the screen.


EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can't type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don't let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5.

EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project... but not if it's UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.

EXTRA CREDIT: Add a "backspace" button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.

EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support!


All of the above completed except for the backspace button.
